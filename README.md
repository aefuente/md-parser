# Markdown Parser

A simple markdown to pdf translator written in the Zig programming language.

## Mission Statement

I often find myself taking notes in markdown. Sometimes these notes are useful
for non-technical users. I wanted to be able to translate markdown into a format
that is consumable via a standalone file that non-technical people could easily
read and wouldn't find concerning to open. I want this file format to be
viewable over preview mechanisms such as Teams, Slack and OneDrive.
